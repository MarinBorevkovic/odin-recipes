    <h1>How to make Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies</h1>
    <p>These oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are packed with oats, walnuts, and gooey chocolate chips. I made them by modifying Beatrice's Excellent Oatmeal Cookies recipe. My boyfriend went crazy over them—I've never seen him enjoy cookies to that extent! He said I blew his mother's recipe away.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and white sugar together in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in eggs one at a time, until well combined; stir in vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Stir flour mixture into egg mixture until just blended. Mix in quick oats, walnuts, and chocolate chips. Drop batter by heaping spoonfuls onto ungreased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
